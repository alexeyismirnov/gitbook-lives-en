# BISHOP PROCLUS OF CONSTANTINOPLE

Saint Proclus (390–446/447) was elected bishop of Constantinople in 434. By tradition, he is called the “patriarch”. However, since the title of “patriarch” was bestowed on the bishop of Constantinople at the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451, such a “premature” designation is an anachronism. For twelve years, Proclus was the bishop of New Rome on the Bosporus, founded in 330 by Constantine the Great. This see did not have apostolic origin, in ecclesiastical significance it was subordinate to the neighboring metropolitan, but by that time its political significance was already great.

Proclus was from the capital region and was made a reader at an early age. In his youth he studied rhetoric, and imitating John Chrysostom (344/349-407) in his preaching style, considered himself his disciple. Choosing Joan as his role model, Proclus soon shared his fate, becoming a victim of court and church intrigues for many years.

So, in 425, when electing a new bishop of the city, the people wanted the election of Proclus, but the powers that be pushed him aside. The new Bishop Sisinnius (+427) ordained him Metropolitan of Cyzicus. According to the ancient canons, the bishop did not have the right to move from one diocese to another.

Thus, Proclus was deliberately prevented from ever returning to his hometown. However, being a simple bishop, Sisinnius himself violated the rules since he could not “appoint” bishops to neighboring dioceses. Thus, Proclus was not accepted by the flock in Cyzicus and was forced to remain to preach in Constantinople. This happened again two years later, until finally the future famous heretic Nestorius was elected primate. When the Third Ecumenical Council in Ephesus (431) deposed Nestorius, Proclus' opponents again, for the third time (!), prevented his election, citing the canons.

Only after the death of the next bishop, Maximian (+434), when it became clear that the number of supporters of the deposed Nestorius was still too large, and the danger of renewed heresy in the capital was too obvious, Proclus was finally elected bishop of Constantinople.

The ministry of Proclus became a ministry of reconciliation, in particular, in the mutual schism of the Alexandrian and Antiochian Churches that arose at that time, which was very dangerous for the unity of believers.

Finally, it was he who asked John Chrysostom (347–407) for forgiveness for the Church of Constantinople for the unjust deposition, exile, and death he suffered from the clergy and court. It was symbolized by the transfer of the relics of the saint from Comana to Constantinople on January 27 in 438 and their position at the Church of the Holy Apostles.

According to the life, even before the formal condemnation of Nestorius at the Third Ecumenical Council in Ephesus, Proclus prophetically polemicized with him, defending the correctness of calling the Blessed Virgin Mary the Mother of God. The exact date of Proclus' death is unknown. It is a providential coincidence that the Church celebrates his memory on the eve of the Entry of the Theotokos into the Temple.
