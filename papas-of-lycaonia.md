# PAPAS OF LYCAONIA

On March 16 (29), the Church celebrates the memory of the martyr Papas of Laranda. The saint suffered for Christ during the reign of Emperor Maximian (286-305). Only a few brief details of the saint's suffering have been preserved in notes to ancient liturgical calendars.

Pope of Laranda, that is, literally, "priest from Laranda". Perhaps the saint was a wandering bishop. The name "Papas" itself means "father", "priest" or "bishop". Most likely, the real name of the saint has not reached us. We know that many ancient martyrs not only did not tell the pagans their names but preferred to call themselves simply "Christian".

The city of Laranda today bears the Turkish name Karaman and is in the central part of southern Anatolia.

The holy Papas preached Christianity in the vicinity of the city. Arrested by the local ruler Magnus, he was tortured. The saint was forced to walk in boots filled with nails to the court.

Educated pagans read the Christian Scriptures and, in anger, despair or simply depression, tried to parody them. Sometimes they seemed to test their feasibility. Like what is said in the Book of Acts about the evil plot of the Jews against the Apostle Paul (Acts 25:3), the ruler most likely hoped that the pagan crowd would pick up the saint on the way and carry out reprisals against him. Obviously, the ruler knew that the saint was innocent. Like Pilate about Jesus in the Gospel, he himself did not find any guilt in the saint (cf. John 19:4) but handed him over to death.

God did not allow the plans of evil people to be fulfilled. Exhausted from incredible pain, the saint stopped under a dried fig tree. Thus, he departed to the Lord. The guards buried him under the tree.

"For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now," writes the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Romans (Rom. 8:22-23). ​​The exodus of the martyr Papas from this world became a prophetic personification of these messianic words about the redemption of all creation. After the death of the martyr, the tree became alive again and began to bear fruit.

The life of the holy Papas also reminds us of the biblical, Orthodox understanding of ecology. Grace is communication. The communion with holiness is beneficial not only for people but also revives the whole of God's world.
