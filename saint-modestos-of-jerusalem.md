# SAINT MODESTOS OF JERUSALEM

On the last day of the year, the Church celebrates the memory of Saint Modest of Jerusalem (537–630). Understanding the essence of his holiness is inseparable from the circumstances of his time.

In 614, the armies of the Iranian Shah Khosroe II Parviz (591–628) entered Palestine. Christians of that time were deeply divided due to Christological disputes. The neighboring Church of Antioch has been divided in two since 519. Two hierarchies and two patriarchs opposed each other, one of whom was Orthodox, the other was an opponent of the decisions of the IV Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon (451). Another Church close to Jerusalem, the Egyptian Church, since 536 almost entirely went over to the side of the formal “heretics.” Palestine hesitated.

Therefore, the coming of the Persians caused confusion among Christians and enthusiasm among local Jews and Samaritans. The Holy City was plundered, Patriarch Zacharias (609–614), the clergy and ordinary Christians were taken into captivity, churches and monasteries were burned. The life-giving Cross of the Lord Jesus was also captured.

The remaining Orthodox began to look with hope towards the Monophysites, to whom the Persians were more favorable. The great merit of Modest, then abbot of the monastery of St. Theodosius the Great (434–529), was the ability to take care of the suffering people.

He persuaded the Persians to show mercy, like the biblical restorer of the Temple in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel (Hag. 1:1), after the Babylonian captivity, he, to the best of his ability, restored the shrines burned by the pagans, primarily the Temple of the Resurrection. His assistant in this matter was his close friend, the holy Patriarch of Alexandria John the Merciful (+616/620), who donated his funds for these works.

At the end of the Persian-Roman War (602–628), on March 21, 630, the Cross of the Lord was returned to Jerusalem. This is how the event of the Second Exaltation of the Cross took place, which is solemnly celebrated by the Church on September 14 (27) as one of the twelf greatest liturgical holidays. The return of the Orthodox army to the Holy Land truly seemed like a great and irreversible triumph.

By that time, Patriarch Zechariah (February 21) had died in captivity. When electing a new patriarch, the choice fell on Modestos. But the patriarchate was very short; apparently, the saint died that same year during a pastoral trip to Palestine. The Arab conquest of Palestine soon began (634–640). Modest was the last patriarch in the ancient Christian history of the Holy City.
