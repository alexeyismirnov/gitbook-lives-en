# SAINT NIKON OF SICILY AND 199 DISCIPLES WITH HIM

Saint Nikon was a wandering bishop. Before his conversion, he served in the Roman army. The Greek name Nikon means "Conqueror".

Fleeing the cruel persecution of Decius (249-251) together with his community, Nikon returned to his native city of Naples. There he converted to Christ and baptized nine of his fellow citizens, who soon became part of the one hundred and ninety-nine disciples who were destined to become martyrs along with Nikon.

All together, they continued their flight from persecution, and landed on the east coast of Sicily in the vicinity of the ancient city of Taormina. Here they were captured by pagans. After long tortures, Nikon's disciples were the first to suffer. He himself suffered last. The saint was beheaded. Before this final execution, his torment was extraordinary.

Soon Nikon's body was found by a shepherd, who, from contact with the relics, was healed of severe demonic possession. The healed sufferer reported this to the bishop of the Sicilian city of Messina. Thus began the veneration of Nikon as a saint. The discovery of relics in the early Church was not accomplished by human will, but occurred by divine direction through signs. This was synonymous with canonization.

In his martyrdom from above, Saint Nikon entered the Communion of Saints, the faith in which is spoken of in the Apostles' Creed. Immediately, he began to do good to those who honor his memory. On the feast of Saint Nikon and his disciples, let us earnestly ask the saints for intercession
