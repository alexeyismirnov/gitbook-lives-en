# SAINT VADIM OF PERSIA

On April 22 (9), the Church honors the memory of the martyr Vadim (+376) and the seven confessors who were his disciples. In the liturgical calendar the saint is called "archimandrite". So, in the ancient monastic tradition, literally, “chiefs of the sheepfold”, the heads of Palestinian monasteries were called. There was fraternal communication between different types of Eastern Orthodox monasteries.

Vadim himself came from the ancient Persian city of Gondishapur, in the Khuzestan region, in western Iran, where Shah Shapur I resettled many Syrian Christians captive by him in 271. According to his life, Vadim led a small monastic community, which he created at his own expense. By order of Shah Shapur II, he was captured along with his disciples.

The Persian state of that time waged brutal wars with Rome. The recognition of Christianity as the official confession of the Roman Empire caused persecution of Christians in Persia, the religion of whose ruling circles was Zoroastrianism. Before this, Christians were not systematically persecuted. Now, on suspicion of disloyalty, anger was brought down on them. The authorities forced Vadim to renounce his faith, but to no avail.

At the same time, a certain prominent dignitary named Nirsan was arrested. Out of fear of torment, he renounced his faith, but they did not believe him. To prove his abdication, Shapur ordered him to behead Vadim with his own hands. For this purpose, the monk was brought to execution. The apostate was overcome by horror, and he was unable to behead the saint, as required by the order. He beat the defenseless prisoner with a sword for a long time and, inflicting many wounds, killed him. The body of the holy martyr was thrown outside the city walls but was found and buried by Christians.

“Greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,” said the Lord in the Gospel (John 15:13). This prophecy of the Lord Jesus about his death for the redemption of mankind was unconditionally, finally irrevocably, and most importantly, uniquely fulfilled on the Cross. It can only partially be reflected in defenseless and suffering human sacrifice. Thus, these words of Christ were fulfilled on Vadim and his friends.

The brutal murder of the monk so horrified the pagans accompanying him that they seemed to “forget” about his disciples. For refusing to make the Zoroastrian pagan sacrifice, they continued to be oppressed in prison, but were no longer threatened with death. Four years later, after Shapur's death, they were released. It is possible that it was these confessors of faith who told the world about the circumstances of Vadim’s martyrdom.

The ancient Persian martyrs represent a separate, great and unique face of holiness. Much of the memory of them has been irretrievably lost. The little that has been preserved in church and historical memory or can be rediscovered by researchers today is subject to precious remembrance.

It is known that the Persian Shah Shapur II (309–379), perhaps the only case in human history, was crowned in his mother’s womb. The crown was placed on her stomach. Shapur's contemporary, Constantine the Great (+337) was baptized on his deathbed. Shapur fought with Constantine and persecuted Christians for more than 40 years. Constantine gaveс freedom to Christians. This biblical opposition between numbers, fate and choice is very mysterious.

Sometimes amazing coincidences accompany saints. The name “Vadim” is perceived by us as of Slavic origin. It sounds similar to the name Vladimir. However, it is not. The Persian name Vadim, Bademus, or Badim, comes from the word "anise". This is one of the “fragrant” Persian flower names.

Martyr Vadim suffered from his own people. The day of his liturgical commemoration, April 22, coincides with the once widely celebrated birthday of Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik ruler of Russia, during whose “reign” the terrible time of the greatest of all fratricides in history began.
