# SAINT SPYRIDON THE WONDERWORKER

On the day when the Western Christian world and the Orthodox Churches following the Gregorian calendar celebrate Christmas, our Church continues its wandering along the paths of the Nativity Fast. So that this path is not traversed alone, the Lord sends us his saints as companions, whose memory is celebrated on these holy preparatory days. Among them is Spyridon, whose memory is celebrated on this extraordinary day of “Western Christmas”.

Saint Spyridon was a contemporary of St Nicholas. However, between them lay the Mediterranean Sea. For Spyridon was a Cypriot, and Nicholas a Lycian - a native of an ancient region, a once glorious country called Lycia with its capital in Myra. Both saints breathed the words of the Apocalypse about the New Heaven and the New Earth, ‘where there is no more sea’ (cf. Apoc. 21:1). Both were born in the second half of the 3rd century, survived the Age of Persecution, and undoubtedly were confessors of the most terrible of them - the Great Persecution under Diocletian (284–305) and his successors.

In order to understand at least a little who these people were, we, who have reached, in the words of the title of Jean-Paul Sartre’s novel, “the age of maturity,” must remember our soldiers who went through the Second World War. Those who were captured or tortured in camps but survived. These were special people, as if made from a different material, or better, from iron. They talked a little, especially about the past. Moreover, their memories are priceless.

Church historians of antiquity have preserved for us an episode when Emperor Constantine the Great (+337) at the Ecumenical Council in Nicaea in 325 met with bishops who had survived persecution. Seeing them in large numbers - one of these confessors had his eye gouged out, another had his hand cut off, or there was a mark on his body - he shed tears. The monarch, who knew no pity, the winner, the autocrat, who postponed baptism until his death in order to administer justice and execute his enemies, as his contemporaries remember, could not hold back his tears.

In the 4th–5th century Roman Empire, which stretched from modern England and Spain to Algeria and Morocco, there were about two thousand Orthodox bishops. Their dioceses were not equal in importance. So, the diocese of St. Augustine, the port of Hippo, modern Algerian Annaba, was somewhere in the middle in this unspoken table of ranks, between the first and second thousand. The diocese of St Spyridon... was one of the last.

He was the bishop of a small settlement, most likely, as was the case in ancient times, a chorbishop, that is, literally, a ‘rural bishop’. As was allowed by the church canons of that time, he was a family man, had a wife and children. Life preserved the name of one of his daughters: ‘Irene’.

From Greek ‘Irene’ means ‘peace’. Spyridon was a Man of Peace, and therefore a Friend of God. ‘For He is our peace, having made both one and destroyed the barrier that stood in the middle,’ writes St Paul (cf. Gal. 2:14).

Before his election, and most likely after, he tended sheep. For a bishop of the Church of Christ this was quite usual. Thus, the great Father of the Church Augustine (354-430), who before his conversion wrote speeches to the emperor in Milan, while a bishop, rode a donkey until the end of his days.

Apart from signs and wonders, history has preserved very little information about Spyridon. Thus, it is known that he participated in a very important Council for the Church in Serdika, modern Bulgarian Sofia, in 343. Most likely soon after that he passed away.

We all live in an era that strives for immortality. No longer believing in Eternal Life, people seek immortality on the Internet. Lot of us are ready for any absurdity, just not to be consigned to oblivion, at least for a day, for a month, for a year. The more we succeed in this, the more we doom ourselves to oblivion anyway.

Therefore, it is important to understand that the worldview of Spyridon, and God’s friends like him, was built on the opposition of the Christian belief in overcoming death by the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus to the idea of ​​​​biological, technological, literary, natural and any other immortality of individuals, people, gods, heroes. Of course, Spyridon did not know all this terminology, which is so familiar and even necessary for us to understand. But that's how he lived. He “trusted in God, believed in God, followed Him”.

“We need to die in such a way that death itself weakens us when it meets us,” writes Andrei Platonov in one of his stories. If we try to translate what has just been said into the language of modern times, we can say that Christian New Testament immortality is not the natural-religious, mythological and not even the biblical Old Testament immortality of procreation, not the bare life of medical technologies and not the “immortality of dictionaries,” or, to paraphrase the title novel by Janusz Leon Wisniewski, 'Immortality on the Web'.

This is extremely important, because both in secular and in our internal church environment the presence, recognition and even desire for such “immortality of networks” is sometimes extremely strong. In particular, a person develops the belief that through a career, construction, hierarchical affiliation or theological creativity, one can firmly enter history and thereby gain “immortality.” This creates the illusion that future generations will read our texts, see our name on bookshelves and, which may seem a very convincing and significant factor, remember and know about us thanks to dictionaries.

“God, who was before time, became man in time in order to free from time,” wrote St. Augustine. Spyridon lived in such a way that these words were fulfilled over him. He did not strive for fame, he wanted to be forgotten.

While his heart was beating here on earth, he sought to do good. To those near and far, as commanded in Scripture. As his life testifies to this. Free from time, he is full of grace. According to Paul, “grace is freedom” (2 Cor. 3:17). Saint Spyridon is doing good to us now to free us from time by the power of the Holy Spirit.
