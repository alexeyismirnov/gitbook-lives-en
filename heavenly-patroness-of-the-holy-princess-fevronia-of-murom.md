# HEAVENLY PATRONESS OF THE HOLY PRINCESS FEVRONIA OF MUROM

1 The name Febronia is linked to the name of the month of February and is associated with the concept of "purification." Like Julius, Augustus, Januarius, and Martin, whose names derive from Roman sacred concepts and became the names of months, Febronia can be both a first name and a nickname.

2 In the case of Saint Febronia, this is particularly evident. After all, in her person, we honor a martyr and a virgin who suffered not only for her Christian faith, but also for her firm desire to remain a virgin forever in the name of faith in Jesus Christ.

3 The first Christian virgins refused to marry pagans because, according to the legal norms of the time, marriage was tantamount to adoption and therefore meant recognizing a pagan husband as their lord and father. For Christians, the father is God himself, and the Lord is Jesus Christ.

4 The city of Nisibis, now Nusaybin, in Turkey, is in the southeast, near the border with Syria. The legend of the Holy Face of Christ the Savior and the celebration of its transfer from Edessa to Constantinople have immortalized these regions. Today, Edessa is called Urfa or Şanlıurfa.

5 Note the frequent inscription "Urfa-Kebab." This is a kebab recipe from the very city where the Holy Face was revealed. This mixture of sacred and secular memories surrounds us everywhere. As the great Russian saint Tikhon of Zadonsk (1724-1783) taught, it is "a spiritual treasure gathered from the world." But it is also a warning. Forgetting the biblical and Christian origins of all that exists leads to extreme impoverishment, when, instead of the image of God, man finds himself faced with a plate of meat.

6 On the map, Edessa and Nisibis are located to the left and right of each other, about 200 kilometers apart. In the early centuries of Christianity, these cities were border crossings of the Roman Empire. For Christians, they served as starting points for the evangelization of distant lands, particularly Persia.

7 Saint Febronia lived at the turn of the 3rd and 4th centuries. She was brutally murdered by pagans. Her life was written by one of the witnesses to her sufferings, a virgin from the same community, and transmitted to the Church by the great bishop of the time, James of Nisibis (+360). A participant in the First Ecumenical Council (325), a contemporary of Saint Nicholas, wonderworker, Father of the Syrian and Persian Church, he was the spiritual father of Saint Ephraim the Syrian.

8 Saint Febronia is the heavenly patroness of Febronia of Murom (+1228). Along with her husband Peter, the Russian saint is highly venerated today as the patroness of fidelity and family. The institution of marriage is rapidly deteriorating in society. The Church prays to God to preserve marriages through the prayers of Saints Peter and Febronia. Saint Febronia of Nisibis is the heavenly protector of Eastern Christianity and Persia. We ask her intercession for lasting and inalienable peace in her Eastern homelands.
