# FIRST AND SECOND FINDING OF THE HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST

On March 8, the Church celebrates the memory of the First and Second Finding of the Head of John the Baptist. In non-leap years, the holiday shifts by one day and is celebrated on March 9. This day usually falls at the beginning of Lent. Therefore, according to the Charter, the Presanctified Liturgy is to be celebrated during the Lent for the Finding of the Head.

The Liturgical Calendar also knows the celebration of the Third Finding of the Head of the Forerunner, which takes place on May 7 (25). Finding the Head of the Forerunner is a historical event. It does not refer to the economy of salvation. However, the Ancient Church still found it necessary to dedicate a special service to him. It is important to try to find an explanation for this.

“The head of the Forerunner rose from the earth as a star, brilliant with rays of immortality. It gathers the choirs of angels in heaven and assembles the human race on earth to sing with one voice the glory of Christ our God,” says the troparion of the holiday, that is, its main hymn.

The Lord Jesus called John the greatest of all righteous people. “Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen a greater one than John the Baptist,” says the Gospel (Matthew 11:11). John is the last of the Old Testament Prophets. In it the Old Testament ends, and the Gospel begins.

John to the people who came to him for Jesus the Messiah. John baptized Christ the Lord who appeared to the world: “And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan” (Mark 1:9). It was John who initiated a gesture, a ritual, a sacred rite that changed the history of the world. This immersion in water, baptism, which in the Apostolic Church became a sacrament, will determine the spiritual heartbeat of humanity until the end of time.

Although the Finding of the Head is a historical event and has no relation to the economy of salvation, the very life of John, from the moment of his conception until his death at the hands of Herod, is directly and clearly in contact with the economy. Let us recall that by economy the theology of the Church understands the divine work, in the original Greek language, literally “the economy of salvation.”

John was a prophet. John was beheaded by Herod. “When Herod heard it, he said, “This is John, whom I beheaded; he rose from the dead” (Mark 6:16). The beheading of His Head became a prophecy about how dishonorable and shameful the death of the Lord itself would be, from the point of view of people.

Therefore, the finding of the Head of John throughout the history of the Church should be understood not by analogy with the discovery of the relics of great saints, but as a sign of the Victory of the Cross, and the holiday itself by analogy with the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross of the Lord.

The Exaltation of the Cross is one of the twelve main holidays of the orthodox Church. It is celebrated on a single day, September 27 (14), but in fact it is a celebration in honor of two findings.

The first finding of the Cross took place under Emperor Constantine. Then, around 326, his mother Helena found the Cross on which Jesus the Lord was crucified in Jerusalem. Almost three centuries later, when the Holy City was invaded by Persian armies, the Cross was captured. In 629, Emperor Heraclius solemnly returned him to the Holy Land from Persia.

In a similar way, also under Constantine the Great, the head of John was found. Then, due to human oversight, it was lost. The second acquisition occurred in 452 under Emperor Marcian. It is obvious that both the Exaltation and the Finding of the Head are a double acquisition. The only difference is that to date, the authentic historical Cross of Christ has been divided into parts and has only been partially preserved. However, the initial historical event acquired a deep theological understanding in the Church.

This did not happen with the Feast of the Finding of the Head. Perhaps this is why, as if in anticipation of the response of the believers, in search of reflection, comprehension and reception, the Third Finding is celebrated separately during the liturgical year.
