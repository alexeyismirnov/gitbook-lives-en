# RAZHDEN THE PROTOMARTYR

On August 16 (3), the Church celebrates the memory of the holy martyr Razhden of Persia (+467). The Georgian Orthodox Church honors him as the first martyr in history to suffer for the faith of Christ in Ancient Iberia, as Georgia was called in ancient times. Therefore, like Saint Deacon Stephen and Saint Thecla, who were the first to suffer for the Gospel back in apostolic times, the Church calls Razhden “Protomartyr.” According to the place of his suffering, the saint also bears the name “Razhden of Kartli” and “Razhden of Iberia”.

From the short biography of the saint that has come down to us, we know that he was the teacher of the daughter of the Persian Shah Hormizd III (457-459) named Balendukht (455-459). The latter became the wife of the Georgian king Vakhtang I (440-502). According to historians, the marriage was intended to strengthen ties between the Persian Empire and the Georgian Kingdom, between which there were then not only friendly, but also family relations. At the same time, the Georgian principalities were in vassal dependence on Persia.

In Georgia, Razhden, who was formerly a Zoroastrian, experienced conversion and became a Christian. Hormizd's reign did not last long. His brother Peroz I (459-484) who deposed him demanded that King Vakhtang end friendly relations with the Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantium, and sent troops into Iberia.

After the Edict of Milan (313), the Ecumenical Council in Nicaea (325) and the baptism of Constantine the Great (+337), Orthodox Christianity became the official faith of the Roman Empire, and therefore Christians, of whom there were many on the territory of Persia, began to fall under the suspicion of the authorities, “at their own discretion”, at times they carried out very cruel persecutions.

According to the life of the saint, by that time Razhden was the ruler of Mtskheta and led the defense of this ancient capital. Captured, he fell to the wrath of the Persian Shah and, for refusing to renounce his faith in Christ, was crucified on the Cross and struck with arrows.

Tradition has preserved the confession of faith that Saint Razhden pronounced in the face of the then all-powerful Persian ruler, whom he undoubtedly knew personally.

In the text, biblical quotes and classical formulas of the ancient Creeds are associated with a great personal, unique conviction. “I left my fatherland and its gods, who serve man and were created to decorate the universe, and now I serve the One True and Living God, Who created Heaven and Earth.” The confession of Saint Razhden should be learned by heart in order to repeat with our soul and lips the words of dogmatic truth and great, unique martyrdom.

The name Razhden translates as “bright”, “glorious religion” or “joyful faith”. Celebrating the memory of the holy protomartyr, we are called to be convinced how truly grace-filled the Christian faith is at all times and in all peoples (cf. Matt. 28:19).
