# FATHERS OF THE SEVENTH ECUMENICAL COUNCIL

Orthodox dogmatics does not accept the theory of dogmatic development. The most it is willing to concede is the sequential adoption of basic dogmas at Seven Ecumenical Councils. The Council of Nicaea is often perceived as the final episode in this development. But it had a continuation, not only in the East, where iconoclasm, contrary to the Council, soon resumed, but also in the West, where the first doctrinal basis for the division of the Eastern and Western Churches was soon laid.

1 The memory of the Fathers of the Seventh Ecumenical Council is celebrated on October 24 if this day falls on a Sunday. If October 24 falls on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, the celebration takes place on the preceding Sunday. Finally, if October 24 falls on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, the service to the Fathers is sung on the following Sunday.

2 The Council took place in 787, from September 24 to October 23. It aimed to oppose the teachings and practices of iconoclasm, which had spread throughout the Eastern Church at that time. Fathers of the Council recognized icon veneration as not only permitted, but also as obligatory. From the "register" of practice, they transferred iconography into the realm of dogma. To paraphrase Umberto Eco, this is one of the most unique and grandiose transsemantic "translations of truth" in history.

2 According to the council's decrees, holy icons are not simply "the Bible for the illiterate," as was previously believed, but direct proof of the visibility and authenticity of the incarnation of the Son of God. An icon is not depicted but written; what is written on the icon, is not arbitrary but follows strict canons. An icon should not convey the elements of the iconographer's imagination, but transmit a different, supernatural existence. The Council also spoke about this.

3 The memory of the Fathers of the Ecumenical Councils is not a personal remembrance of their holy participants, but a celebration of the Councils as key events in church history. The memory of each of them, the first six, as well as all of them together, is celebrated during the Orthodox liturgical year. In Moscow's St. Daniel Monastery, the church where monks gather daily for worship is dedicated to the "Fathers of the Seven Ecumenical Councils." This example highlights the extraordinary role of the Seven Ecumenical Councils in Orthodoxy.

4 In the Orthodox Church, the Seventh Ecumenical Council was the last in history. The reason for this is that, by analogy with the First Ecumenical Council, initiated by Constantine the Great, all subsequent Councils were convened by the emperor. There is no canonical basis for this practice. It can rather be considered an ancient analogue of case law. If the first council was convened by the emperor and was successful, then, according to the logic of Eastern Byzantine Orthodoxy, all subsequent councils should also have been convened by the ruler

6 Just 13 years after the Seventh Council, in 800, on Christmas Day, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the West in Rome, contrary to the principled position of the heirs of the Roman Caesars in Constantinople. The idea that only one Christian Empire could exist on earth was undermined. In relation to the conciliar life of the Church, this meant that ecumenical councils could no longer be convened by decision of the Eastern Emperor. Sometimes, 13 is really an unlucky number.

7 However, in the minds of contemporaries of those events, the belief in the unity of the Empire continued to exist. Representatives of both courts, hierarchs and theologians, began to look for reasons to accuse each other of heresy. This desire to separate themselves at the level of doctrine was linked to the practice of reading with the practice of reading the Creed during the Divine Liturgy, or Mass, as the Eucharistic service was called in Western Christianity. By that time, the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 had been read for centuries during Byzantine worship, but not during the Latin Mass. The practice of reading was introduced at this very moment in history, and it was introduced by Charlemagne! He also added the phrase "and from the Son" (Latin: filioque) to the Nicene Creed. This laid a very serious foundation for the final division between the Eastern and Western Churches. After all, the Creed was not only changed in the West, but, having become part of the divine liturgy, acquired a special sacred inviolability.

8 The term "Orthodoxy," which became the definition of Eastern Christianity, meant a confession of faith that was officially approved by the authorities of the Roman Empire. It should be noted that the word "Byzantium" was introduced into use by modern Western researchers, while the "Byzantines" themselves perceived themselves and were perceived by others precisely as "Romans."

9 By a remarkable coincidence, the Seventh Ecumenical Council, which was to be the last in Orthodox history, was held in Nicaea, just like the first one. The Church of Hagia Sophia, where it was held, has been preserved. It was possible to see ancient frescoes there, but in 2011 it was converted into a mosque. It is interesting to note that the "Byzantine" iconoclasm of the 8th century, in response to which this "Last Council" was convened, was largely motivated by the influence of Islam, which was rapidly spreading at the time.

10 The significance of the Ecumenical Councils for Orthodoxy is enormous. The study of the Ecumenical Councils takes on new dimensions with each era, and the richness of their heritage is inexhaustible. It is remarkable that in contemporary theology, let us remember the famous theologian of our time, Bishop Kallistos Ware (1934-2022), Orthodoxy is often referred to as the Church of the Seven Councils.
