# MANUEL

On June 30, the last day of the first month of summer, the Church celebrates the commemoration of the holy martyrs Manuel, Sabel, and Ismael. The saints were diplomats representing the Shah of Persia at the court of Emperor Julian the Apostate (361â€“363).

During the solemn ceremony, Julian offered to speculate about God, but the saints refused. When she used the impossibility of mixing state duties and religion as an argument, Julian realized that there were Christians before him. He accused the messenger of espionage and had them sit out a painful execution.

At the heart of the New Testament's attitude toward the commandments of God is to personify the commandment, to make it shine. Manuel, Sabel, and Ismael teach true religiosity that one must always be able to separate in relation to God and everything else. In our time of general observability, it is important for Christians, as true "messengers of another", not to speak about God in vain and to learn to hide and be silent.
