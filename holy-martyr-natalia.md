# HOLY MARTYR NATALIA

The name Natalia is one of the most popular names in Slavic Orthodox Christianity. What does it mean?

1 The name "Natalia" is one of the very few names that has at least a triple dedication. One of them is the main one. The second and third, if one can say so about human names and their dedication, are secondary.

2 The first dedication of the name Natalia is Christmas. Christmas Day—Dies Natalis Christi—is the Latin name for Christmas. Those who bear the name "Natalia" are named in honor of the Nativity of Jesus. Christmas is their main name day.

3 The second dedication of the name Natalia is the day of martyrdom of the saints. Early Christians did not celebrate their own birthdays; moreover, they called the days of the martyrs' deaths "birthdays" - dies natalis. Hence the second meaning of the name Natalia - named in honor of the glory of the Christian martyrs.

4 Finally, the third dedication is in honor of the holy martyr Natalia, whose memory is celebrated by the Orthodox Church on September 8, together with her husband holy martyr Adrian.

5 Modern hagiology, that is, the scientific study of saints, considers the lives of Saints Adrian and Natalia to be a literary work, a kind of novel in its early medieval form. The Church is a community of interpreters. For Orthodox Christians, this or that form of sacred narrative is by no means a cause for doubt. The God of the Bible did not clothe Himself in numbers and technology, but in the absurd and, at the same time, beautiful garment of human words. At the end of history, God, is Christ Jesus, took upon Himself our flesh and blood. The life of Saint Natalia, together with her husband Adrian, is an edifying example of the faith of Jesus' followers in the early centuries of Christianity.
