# APOSTLES BARTHOLOMEW AND BARNABAS

On June 24, the Church celebrates the memory of the holy Apostles Bartholomew and Barnabas. This is a joint apostolic memorial, similar to that of Peter and Paul, which will be celebrated eighteen days later. Like Peter and Paul, the Apostles Bartholomew and Barnabas did not preach together.

Most commentators identify Bartholomew, whose name is probably translated from Hebrew as "Son of Ptolemy," with Nathanael, whose calling by Christ is mentioned at the very beginning of the Gospel of John in the Lord's words: "I saw you under the fig tree" (John 1:48). The apostolic work of Barnabas, whose name means "Son of Consolation," is described in detail in the Book of Acts. Bartholomew was one of the twelve apostles, Barnabas, according to tradition, one of the seventy disciples.

Bartholomew is considered the first founder of the Church of Armenia, and Barnabas is considered the patron of the Churches of Milan and Cyprus. For the ancient Churches, this apostolic origin was extremely important, as it attested to their right to independence in their internal governance.

The common celebration in their honor probably reflects the historical coincidence of the date of their anniversary, a name that the apostolic Christians themselves gave to the death of martyrs. On a theological and symbolic level, it perfectly designates the property of the Church of Christ, inscribed in the most ancient creeds of faith, calling the Church "apostolic."

"Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; "No one claimed that any of his possessions were his own, but they had all things in common," says Acts (4:32). According to Acts, Barnabas also sold his land, brought the money, and laid it at the Apostles' feet. From this brief description of the existence of the first community of Christ's disciples, it follows that the Church called herself "apostolic" not only by virtue of its foundation, teaching, succession, and ordination, but also because she was poor.
