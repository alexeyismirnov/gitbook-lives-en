# CARTERIUS OF CAESAREA

Saint Carterius was a priest in Caesarea of ​​Cappadocia. He converted many people to Christ with his preaching. During the Great Persecution of Diocletian (303-313), he hid from his persecutors in accordance with the practice and canons of that time. But the Lord, in a special vision, commanded him to come out of hiding and continue the gospel, promising His assistance. "Go, Carterius, for many will believe and be saved through you," the Lord said in the vision.

He was soon arrested and then brought before the governor. He was asked to make a sacrifice to a pagan deity. For refusing, he was subjected to numerous tortures, during which the saint was convinced in a special vision that angels were present at his martyrdom. "An angel of the Lord eased his sufferings and the soldier of Christ remained alive," the life says.

Once again imprisoned, where he was tortured again, the saint, for the second time since his confession, was honored with an appearance of Jesus. Then he appeared before the court for the third time. The sight of the holy martyr, who, like the Lord, who in the Gospel was handed over to trial from Pilate to Herod, and back (cf. Luke 23:11), but persistently returned alive to testify, caused the conversion of the pagans to the faith.

Neither threats nor tortures shook his resolve. Then one of the servants, in a God-fighting zeal, pierced the priest's side with a spear. And so, as if repeating the Gospel narrative, from the saint's wound "flowed blood and water" (John 19:34).

From the example of Saint Carterius, we learn how the life of a Chrtistian can be literally translated into the language of the Gospel narrative. "He came out of hiding and preached everywhere" - this is the main testament of the martyr to those who in our last times honor his memory and wish to follow his example.
