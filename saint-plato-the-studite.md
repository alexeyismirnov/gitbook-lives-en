# SAINT PLATO THE STUDITE

Saint Plato the Studite (740–814) was the uncle of Saint Theodore the Studite (759–826), the most significant theologian and teacher of spiritual life in the Byzantine Church in the 8th–9th centuries. Both ascetics received their name in honor of the monastery in Constantinople, to which they moved from the monastery they had founded in Asia Minor, Anatolia. The Church celebrates the memory of Saint Plato on April 18 (5).

The Studite monastery was founded by the benefactor of the same name in the 5th century. It once lived according to the rule of unceasing monks. That is, the worship service in it never stopped during the day and night. Plato's resettlement occurred due to the constant raids of Arab armies and pirates on his former monastery.

The Holy Empress Irene (752–803), who restored the veneration of icons at the Seventh Ecumenical Council in 787, honored the ascetics in this way. She entrusted them with the task of reviving the Studite Monastery, which was going through a difficult period at that time.

Saint Plato was a strict ascetic. His monastery had such a high level of communal living that the monks had absolutely nothing of their own. Thus, the brethren’s clothes resembled sacks, they were of a huge size so that everyone could fit. After the general washing, they were distributed to everyone indiscriminately, from the abbot to the youngest novice.

During the era of iconoclasm, Plato opposed this heresy, which was destructive for the Church, its spiritual life, theology, art, and monasticism. And during the time of church peace, he irreconcilably criticized the moral indulgences that subsequent emperors allowed themselves. For all this, the saint had to suffer much from the powers that be. The Church honors Plato as a confessor.

The example of the saint teaches us that it is possible to resist heretics with force and conviction, as well as to expose the vices of modern times, only when you yourself live in accordance with the Gospel covenants, and in visible accordance with the baptismal, for laymen, or monastic, for monks, vows taken upon yourself. Saint Plato confessed what he preached. In these last times, he calls Orthodox Christians to follow his example of holy humble impeccability.
