# MARTYR ARETHAS AND 4299 MARTYRS WITH HIM

The ancient Arabian city of Najran is located in the southwest of modern Saudi Arabia near the Yemeni border. In ancient times, there was a large Christian community in the city. Around 518, the ruler of one of the neighboring Arab principalities named Dhu Nuwas, who is also called Dunaan in the ancient Christian texts, converted to Judaism. He soon began a policy of conquest and began the siege of Najran. Unable to take the city by force, he swore by "the Lord of Heaven and Law and the heavenly hosts" that he would not harm any of those who submitted to his future dominion.

The citizens opened the city gates for him, after which the invader immediately broke his oath. He brought down his unrighteous wrath on Christians, demanding that they renounce their faith. For the sake of intimidation, he burned the relics of the deceased Bishop Paul, who was revered by believers. Then he exterminated the governor Aretha, and with him 427 clergy, monks and virgins, and 4252 laymen. The martyrdom of the Christian community took place on October 24 (November 6), 523, and the narrative of the suffering itself was written down only a few decades later. This brutal killing of Christians is mentioned and condemned in the Qur'an (85:4-7). Monthly scholars speak of 4299 martyrs who were burned and otherwise killed; according to the ancient lives of holy martyrs, there were more.

Among the martyrs suffered was the righteous Christian widow Syncletica and her two daughters. For their refusal to renounce Christianity, the Najran usurper ordered the saints to be led around the city like criminals and, after much torture, ordered their beheadings. The memory of the holy martyrs is an example of ancient Christian female holiness, and therefore is celebrated separately on the same day.

The narrative of the suffering of the holy Arabian martyrs is striking in its historical and edifying quality. According to their life, the ruler addressed Christians with the following words: “I do not demand from you any renunciation of God, just do not believe in Jesus Christ anymore.” The celebration in honor of the saints, carried out by the Church on the eve of the tragic date of November 7 (October 25), prophetically recalls our countless brothers and sisters in Christ who, having believed the Bolshevik promises of peace and forgiveness, endured bitter torment, but retained faith in the Lord Jesus.
