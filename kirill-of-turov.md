# KIRILL OF TUROV

On May 11, the Church celebrates the memory of St. Kirill of Turov (1130–1182). This great ancient Russian saint of the 12th century was an ascetic, a monk by vocation, one of the most educated people of his time and an impeccable medieval bishop in his service.

Cyril was the son of noble parents, received a Christian education, and, undoubtedly, from his youth knew the Holy Scriptures very well. Having become a monk of the Turov Boris and Gleb Monastery, Kirill eventually devoted himself to seclusion, but accepted those who came to him for Christian instruction. On March 6, 1174, the Metropolitan of Kiev ordained him Bishop of Turov. Three years before his death, the saint left the department and retired into seclusion in his native monastery. On April 28 (May 11), 1182, Kirill departed to the Lord.

Since the time of his episcopal ministry, 12 sermons have reached us. It was these preserved treasures of ancient Russian preaching art that earned him the fame of the “Russian Chrysostom.” In addition, 24 prayers, a canon of repentance and an exhortation to the monastic life of the saint have been preserved. A pious monastic bishop, Kirill entered the memory of the Church as a meek refutation of the common assertion that Rus' was baptized, but not enlightened.
