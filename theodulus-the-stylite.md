# THEODULUS THE STYLITE

From the life of Saint Theodulus the Stylite (+440) we learn that he was formerly a high dignitary at the imperial court in Constantinople. Despite the formal confession of Orthodoxy, the morals there were cruel and hypocritical. Injustice reigned. Therefore Theodulus left the service.

The moment of renunciation coincided for him with widowhood. He distributed his estate in memory of the soul of his wife, and then went to Edessa. At that time it was a remote border town on the border of the Roman Empire and Persia, in the vicinity lived many ascetics. Theodulus chose the pillar as his feat. At the age of 42 he ascended the pillar, on which he remained for 30 years. His food was blessed bread, antidoron, which, once a week, on Sundays, the priest brought along with the sacrament.

Like many great ascetics of that time, after a long time of asceticism, Theodulus asked himself whether he had pleased God. Then grace showed him to go to Damascus. So he met an actor named Cornelius. Although rich, the actor led a dissolute life. One day he met a very beautiful woman. She asked for alms so as not to upset her husband, who was accustomed to living extravagantly. So she hid from him that their former prosperity was gone.

Grace touched the heart of Cornelius. He understood that behind his own external splendor was hidden the death of the soul. It was the destruction and ugliness of the inner man, which he tried to hide. Then he gave money and even his rich outer clothing to the woman and asked her to remember him in prayers.

What he saw greatly saddened Theodulus. He understood that when he renounced the world and gave alms for the memory of his wife's soul, he should have asked for himself as well. He was once married. And, like all people, he allowed many everyday injustices and evils. It was too late to ask for forgiveness and do good. So, at the end of his feat, he experienced his second conversion. The example of Theodulus teaches how virtue is revealed in everyday things, and holiness in love for neighbors and loved ones.
