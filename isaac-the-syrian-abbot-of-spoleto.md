# ISAAC THE SYRIAN, ABBOT OF SPOLETO

Just as we learn about Saint Benedict of Nursia, Presbyter Severus, and other ancient Italian saints, we know about Saint Isaac the Syrian from the “Dialogues” of Saint Gregory the Great, Bishop of Rome, whose name is given to the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts in Orthodox worship. The memory of Saint Isaac is celebrated on April 25 (12).

The saint labored in the central part of the Apennine Peninsula in the historical region of Umbria. According to the place of his exploits, he is also called Isaac of Monteluco in Italy, or, in the Orthodox calendar, Isaac the Syrian.

The saint did indeed come from Syria, but he should be distinguished from another Isaac the Syrian, a great spiritual writer quoted by Dostoevsky in his words about the “merciful heart” in the novel “The Brothers Karamazov.” The latter stayed his entire life in the Middle East and lived a century later.

Isaac the Syrian appeared in Italy, apparently fleeing the persecution of the Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius (491-518). The Byzantine ruler supported the Monophysites, sought to abolish the results of the Fourth Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon (451) on ​​​​Christology and persecuted the Orthodox. Isaac lived as a hermit.

One day he came to pray in the cathedral of the city of Spoleto and, in the image of the three-day rest of the Lord in the Tomb, wanted to remain in contemplative prayer for three days and three nights. This was one of the characteristic types of prayerful feat of the Syrian ascetics. The lying prayer in the form of the Cross, in the image of the rest of the dead, is still preserved in the Orthodox monastic tonsure.

The indignant servant wanted to expel Isaac from the temple, but the wrath from above struck him with demonic possession. This is one of the most severe and mysterious forms of punishment. In the context of the life of the saint, this testifies to how great the personality of the humble ascetic was before the Lord, who, being a stranger and pilgrim on earth (Heb. 11:13), could not defend himself. Blessed are the meek (Matt. 5:5), for God defends the defenseless.

It is possible that, based on the form of the Syrian prayer, Saint Isaac was taken for a Monophysite, from whose persecution he was fleeing. After all, it was in Syria that they were very numerous.

The acolyte was healed only by the mercy of Isaac. From that moment on, disciples began to gather around the saint. This is how a veritable lavra was born, a vast monastery, a type of monasticism previously unknown in the Orthodox Christian West. Ruins of monastic buildings can be seen in the vicinity of Monteluco in Italy.

The example of St. Isaac teaches us not to disturb our neighbors in the church, not to interfere with their prayer and not to teach in vain. We should avoid condemning ancient practices and rules that Christians practice, which we simply do not know about. "Do not go to someone else's monastery with your own rules," says a Russian proverb. And, conversely, in your monastery or temple you cannot offend those who, being a guest, pray differently. The Lord can turn any human error and weakness to His Glory.

The Church, as the People of God wandering in earthly history, celebrates the Resurrection of Christ, and Saint Isaac the Syrian always abides in Paschal Glory in Heaven and intercedes for those who honor his memory.
