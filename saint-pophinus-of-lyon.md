# SAINT POPHINUS OF LYON

On June 15 (2), the Church honors the memory of the holy martyr Pothinus and those who suffered with him. Pothinus (85–177) was a disciple of the Apostle John the Theologian. From Asia Minor, where John led the church community in the last years of his long life, Pothinus went to preach the Gospel in Gaul. In Lyon he became the first Christian bishop.

In 177, Christians suffered persecution caused by an outburst of insane anger from a pagan crowd. By killing Christians, the pagans thought that they were thereby avenging their gods. More than two centuries later, in 424, the Father of the Church, St. Augustine of Hippo, whose memory is also celebrated on June 15, but according to the Julian calendar, in his work “Care for the Dead,” wrote this about the Lyon martyrs.

“In the Ecclesiastical History, written in Greek by Eusebius, and translated into Latin by Ruffin we read the following fact. In Gaul, bodies of martyrs were thrown to the dogs; what the dogs left was thrown into the flames with the bones and completely consumed; and the ashes in turn thrown into the Rhône River, so that no memory of them would remain.

We must believe that God had no other design, in allowing these incredible abuses, than to teach Christians who despise the present life by confessing Christ, to despise burial even more. For if such treatments exercised on the bodies of martyrs were an obstacle to the blessed rest of their victorious souls, God would certainly not allow it.

The meaning of the Lord's words is therefore clarified by the very fact. When he said: "Do not fear those who kill the body, and then have no more power” (Luke 12:4), he did not mean that he would leave them no power over the bodies of the dead, but although, whatever they did, the happiness of deceased Christians would in no way be diminished, the senses of those who are full of life after death would in no way be affected, and their bodies themselves would not suffer any damage, at least with regard to the integrity of their resurrection”, - this is what St Augustine wrote.

Commemorating the ancient Lyon martyrs with Bishop Pothinus, we also remember their spiritual brothers (cf. Rev. 6:11), the New Martyrs of our Church, whose relics rest in unknown places. Holy martyrs, ancient and new, full of life after death, we ask your intercession in Heavenly Glory before our God and Father.
