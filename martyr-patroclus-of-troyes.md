# MARTYR PATROCLUS OF TROYES

"Do you see the cross on the top of that hill? There are ten soldiers under it. Go hang on it. And when you get tired of this, come back and walk on the water with me," Jesus addresses Apostle Andrew in a song by the Russian group "Nautilus Pompilius." Martyr Patroclus of Troyes was one of the "holy water walkers," that is, those saints who literally walked on water in their lives and sufferings. The ancient church historian Saint Gregory of Tours wrote about the saint. It is very noteworthy that Gregory is also the author of the "Book of the Miracles of Apostle Andrew." In reverse order to the song of the Nautilus, Saint Patroclus first "walked on the water" of the River Seine and was then beheaded on the hill that still stands today.

1 Remembering the saints' days is a virtue for which God grants His grace. This is facilitated by the coincidence of the beginning, end or middle of the month, as well as the possible coincidence of the days of remembrance of some saints with civil holidays. The dates vary depending on the Julian or Gregorian calendar. For example, the Orthodox Churches of the old calendar celebrate the memory of the holy martyr Patroclus from the French city of Troyes on August 30, the penultimate day of summer. The veneration of this ancient Christian saint, who was martyred in Gaul, continues to this day. In addition to France, Saint Patroclus is especially revered in Westphalia.

2 Saint Gregory of Tours mentions the martyr Patroclus in chapter 63 of his work "Liber in gloria confessorum," written between 588 and 592. Gregory himself lived from 538 to 594, a little more than three centuries after Saint Patroclus. He writes that the martyr's tomb is located in the city of Troyes and that many miracles emanated from him, proving that Patroclus was "a friend of God." Above his tomb, there used to be only a small church with a single priest, as the saint's life was unknown. "When peasants know the deeds of God's saints, they venerate them with greater zeal," Gregory writes.

3 A pilgrim brought a book containing the martyr's sufferings and, at Gregory's own instruction, gave it to the lector serving in the martyr's church to read. Overcome by spiritual joy, he read it and, by lamplight, copied it out in one sitting that same night and gave it to the local bishop. The bishop, however, did not believe it, considering what he had written an "exercise of personal piety" in accordance with a private vow. But after some time, "the Gallic army set out for Italy." From there, a document about the martyr's sufferings was brought, the contents of which coincided with those previously copied by the clergyman. The bishop felt "great confusion." The people "began to honor the martyr with greater zeal, a basilica was built over his relics, and a great celebration was held every year."

4 Saint Patroclus was a citizen of noble birth. During the reigns of Emperors Valerian (253–260) or Aurelian (270–275), he was accused of professing Christianity and beheaded on January 21 on "Mount Idols." The martyr's execution was preceded by a sign: the pagans attempted to drown the saint in the Seine, but he walked on water, thus repeating the miracle of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel. Thus, it was testified that the martyrs' strength did not come from themselves, but from Jesus Christ, whose testimony to the truth they confirmed through their lives and, above all, through their deaths. "Christ died for all, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died and rose again for them," writes the Apostle Paul in his Second Letter to the Corinthians (5:15). The place where the martyr suffered has survived to this day and is called Saint-Parre-au-Tertre, that is, literally, "The Heights of Saint Patroclus."
